# Technical Role — Technical Environment Document Interview

Structured interview that produces `Product-Definition/technical-environment.md`. Based on the AI-DLC `docs/writing-inputs/technical-environment-guide.md` structure.

---

## Context loading

Before the first question, load for context (do NOT modify):

- `Product-Definition/vision-document.md` if it exists (from the Business role)
- `Product-Definition/interview/project-type.md`
- `Product-Definition/interview/role-selection.md`

If the Vision Document exists, use it to pre-fill educated defaults in questions (e.g. suggest a deployment model aligned with the MVP's NFR priorities). Always present the user with full options anyway — the Technical role may override Business-driven assumptions.

## Step 0 — Depth selection (run ONCE at the start of the Technical role)

Write this into `Product-Definition/interview/technical/tech-env-questions.md`:

```markdown
# Technical Interview — Depth Selection

Pick the interview depth. You can upgrade Quick → Full later if needed.

A) **Quick pass** (~10 questions, ~12 min)
   Core-only questions. Good for prototypes, POCs, internal tools, or
   brand-new projects without strict compliance needs.

B) **Full interview** (~29 questions, ~35 min)
   Covers every section of the Technical Environment guide, including
   security, testing, and example code patterns. Recommended for
   production-grade projects, regulated workloads, and codebases where
   convention matters.

X) Other (e.g. "Full but skip Example Code" — describe after [Answer]:)

[Answer]:

---

When you're done, reply with a single word: **ready**
```

When the user replies `ready`:

1. Re-read, validate the letter.
2. Record the chosen depth:
   ```markdown
   ## Session Metadata
   - Technical Depth: <Quick | Full | Custom:{description}>
   ```
3. Build the question set:
   - **Quick** → only `[CORE]` questions (10 for brand-new projects / 13 when there is an existing system).
   - **Full** → every question.
   - **Custom** → interpret and confirm before proceeding.

## How the interview is structured

Same as the Business interview:

1. Select unanswered questions from the bank matching depth and project type.
2. Write 5–7 questions per batch into `Product-Definition/interview/technical/tech-env-questions.md`.
3. Start every batch with the mandatory **progress header** and end with the mandatory **footer**:

   ```markdown
   # Technical Interview — Section {N} of {Total}: {Section Title}

   Progress: {bar} {answered}/{total} questions  ·  ~{minutes_left} min remaining

   This batch covers Q{first}–Q{last}. Fill in the [Answer]: tags below,
   then reply with **"ready"** and I'll validate your answers and move on.

   ... questions ...

   ---

   When you're done, reply with a single word: **ready**
   ```

4. Include the one-time "How to answer" block only on the very first batch.
5. Wait for `ready`. Re-read. Validate. Append the batch to `tech-env-answers-history.md`. Mark checkboxes. Log to audit. (Batch-scoped — see `common/question-format-guide.md` §"Batched writes".)

**Branching** (AI-internal logic — the user never sees these terms):
- If `Project Type = Greenfield` (user picked A — brand-new), skip the "Existing System" questions.
- If `Project Type = Brownfield` or `Hybrid` (user picked B, C, or qualifying X), include them.

```

#### T4 — Team size and experience

```markdown
## Question T4: Describe the team that will build and own this.

We'll use this to tune recommendations (e.g. a 2-person team shouldn't
adopt Kubernetes unless there's experience).

Example: "3 engineers. Strong in TypeScript/Node and AWS. No prior
Kubernetes experience. One engineer has deep Python/Pandas expertise."

[Answer]:
```

### Section T2: Programming Languages

#### T5 [CORE] — Required languages

```markdown
## Question T5: Which languages MUST be used, for which purpose?

Replace the example row below with your own data.

```

#### T6 — Permitted languages

```markdown
## Question T6: Which languages are permitted (allowed if justified)?

**Example (do not submit as your answer):**

| Language | Conditions for Use |
|----------|--------------------|

B) None — no language is explicitly prohibited
X) Other

[Answer]:

| Language | Reason |
|----------|--------|
|          |        |
```

### Section T3: Frameworks and Libraries

#### T8 [CORE] — Required frameworks

```markdown
## Question T8: Which frameworks MUST be used, for which domain?

**Example (do not submit as your answer):**

| Framework | Domain | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|

[Answer]:

| Framework | Conditions for Use |
|-----------|--------------------|
|           |                    |
```

#### T10 [CORE] — Prohibited libraries (with alternatives)

```markdown
## Question T10: Which libraries are prohibited? Include the reason AND the recommended alternative.

The reason + alternative columns matter more than a plain "do not use" list.
Without them, AI-DLC will honour the prohibition but may pick a poor substitute.

**Example (do not submit as your answer):**

| Prohibited | Reason | Use Instead |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| (e.g.) axios | Bundle size / security history | native fetch + abort-controller wrapper |

[Answer]:

| Prohibited | Reason | Use Instead |
|------------|--------|-------------|

### Section T8: Example Code Patterns

> **Important**: these patterns are the single highest-leverage input to AI-DLC code generation. Each question supports **three valid ways to answer** — don't skip if you don't have a polished snippet handy.

#### T26 — Example endpoint pattern

```markdown
## Question T26: Example endpoint pattern

There are three valid ways to answer:

A) Paste a canonical snippet below inside a code fence
B) Point me to a file path I can read (e.g. "see src/routes/users.py in this repo")
C) Skip — we'll infer from framework conventions (AI-DLC code quality drops
   roughly 20% without at least one concrete example; we'll flag this as an
   open question for later)
X) Other

[Answer]:

<!-- If A, paste code here:
```{language}
// your snippet
```
-->
```

#### T27 — Example function / module pattern

```markdown
## Question T27: Example function / module pattern

Illustrate typical error handling, logging, and dependency-injection conventions.

A) Paste a canonical snippet below
B) Point me to a file path
C) Skip — use framework defaults
X) Other

[Answer]:
```

#### T28 — Example test pattern

```markdown
## Question T28: Example test pattern

Include setup/teardown conventions if relevant.

A) Paste a canonical snippet below
B) Point me to a file path
C) Skip — use framework defaults
X) Other

[Answer]:
```

#### T29 — Example infrastructure snippet

```markdown
## Question T29: Example infrastructure-as-code snippet

(CDK / Terraform / CloudFormation / other)

A) Paste a snippet below
B) Point me to a file path
C) Not applicable — no IaC in scope
X) Other

[Answer]:
```

### Existing System — ask only if the user is building on or migrating an existing system (project type B or C)

#### TB1 [CORE] — Existing stack inventory

```markdown
## Question TB1: What's in the existing stack today?

**Example (do not submit as your answer):**

| Language / Framework | Current Usage | Direction |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------|
| (e.g.) Java 11 | Core backend services | Upgrade to Java 21 in Phase 2 |
| (e.g.) JavaScript | Legacy frontend | Migrate to TypeScript |

"Direction" examples: Maintain | Upgrade to X | Migrate away | Deprecate.

[Answer]:

| Language / Framework | Current Usage | Direction |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------|
|                      |               |           |
```

#### TB2 [CORE] — What must stay unchanged

```markdown
## Question TB2: Which services, schemas, contracts, or configs must NOT be touched?

Example:
  - Payments service API (frozen for PCI audit until Q3)
  - `users` table schema (downstream ETL depends on column order)
  - Existing SSO callback URLs

[Answer]:
```

#### TB3 [CORE] — Prohibited patterns

```markdown
## Question TB3: Which libraries or patterns conflict with your existing codebase?

E.g. "don't introduce a second ORM", "don't mix async/await in this Django app", etc.

A) I'll write a bulleted list
B) None beyond the language/library prohibitions already listed in T7/T10
X) Other

[Answer]:
```

#### TB4 — Source of example code

```markdown
## Question TB4: For the Example Code Patterns section, where do examples come from?

A) I'll point to real files in the repository (AI-DLC should load them)
B) I'll paste snippets pulled directly from existing files
C) Mix
X) Other

[Answer]:
```

## Validation guidance

- **T7, T10, T12** (prohibited lists): warn the user if all three are empty — *"No prohibitions usually means AI-DLC will reach for its defaults, which may not match your house style. Is that intentional?"*
- **T10**: every row MUST have both a reason and a recommended alternative. Flag missing alternatives.
- **T21** (compliance): if a compliance framework is selected, add a reminder to the open-questions collector to ensure T17–T20 align with that framework.
- **T26–T29** (example code): if ALL four are answered C) Skip, flag the risk — AI-DLC code quality drops significantly. Offer a one-shot follow-up: *"Can you point me to just one existing service whose patterns should guide new code?"*
- **T18 + T21 cross-check**: if `T21 = HIPAA` but `T18 != A (everything at rest and in transit)`, flag as a contradiction and ask to resolve before rendering.

## When the section is complete

Same pattern as Business: append a "Section {N} Complete" marker to `tech-env-answers-history.md`, overwrite the next batch into `tech-env-questions.md`, log in `audit.md` with stage label `Technical Interview — Section {N} Complete`.

When the last section is complete, hand off to `technical/tech-env-completion.md`.
